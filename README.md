# Backend Module



## What is a Backend?

A backend (or "server-side") application handles tasks like:
- Storing and retrieving data from databases
- User authentication and authorization
- Business logic processing
- API endpoints that client applications can communicate with



## Features

- User registration with unique user IDs
- Secure login and authentication
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Password hashing for security

## Getting Started with Node.js

If you're new to Node.js development, follow these steps(If you have installed firebase, you can skip this section as firebase requires Node.js):

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   node -v   # Shows Node.js version
   npm -v    # Shows npm (Node Package Manager) version
   ```
3. **Understanding package.json**: This file lists project dependencies and scripts
4. **Node modules**: Libraries installed via npm are stored in the "node_modules" folder

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- MongoDB instance

### Setup Steps

1. Download the zip file from the repository and extract it to your desired location. Open it in VS Code or your preferred code editor.

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=3000                                     # The port your server will run on
MONGODB_URI=<your connection_string>  # Connection to MongoDB
JWT_SECRET=<some_random_string>        # Secret key for JWT authentication
```

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when you make changes to the code.

## Project Structure Explained

```
/
├── index.js                 # Application entry point - starts the server
├── src/                     # Source code directory
│   ├── app.js               # Express setup - configures the web server

│       └── connectDB.js     # Database connection - connects to MongoDB
└── .env                     # Environment variables (not in repository)
```

### Key Files Explained

- **index.js**: The starting point of the application. It loads environment variables, connects to the database, and starts the server.

- **app.js**: Creates and configures the Express application, setting up middleware for parsing requests.

- **routes/auth.route.js**: Defines the URLs for authentication operations and connects them to controller functions.

- **controllers/login.controller.js**: Contains the logic for authenticating users, comparing passwords, and updating login state.

- **models/User.js**: Defines the structure of user data in the database using Mongoose schema.

## Understanding HTTP Methods

This API uses these HTTP methods:
- **GET**: Retrieve data (like health check)
- **POST**: Create or update data (like register, login)

HTTP status codes in responses:
- **200**: Success (OK)
- **201**: Created successfully
- **400**: Bad request (client error)
- **404**: Not found
- **500**: Server error

## Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored as plain text. We use bcrypt which:
  - Adds random "salt" to make each hash unique
  - Uses one-way encryption that can't be reversed

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are checked to:
  - Prevent malicious data
  - Ensure required fields are provided
  - Reject invalid formats

- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to securely identify users after login. They:
  - Contain user information and a signature
  - Are sent in the Authorization header for protected routes
  - Allow stateless authentication (no session storage needed)

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like database credentials are kept in .env files that aren't committed to repositories.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
If you see "Error connecting to MongoDB", check:
- Is MongoDB running?
- Is your MONGODB_URI correct in the .env file?
- Do you have network access to the database?

### "Module not found" Errors
Run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are installed.

### Server Won't Start
- Check if another application is using the same port
- Verify that your .env file exists with the correct variables

## Development

To run in development mode with nodemon (automatically restarts when code changes):

```bash
npm run dev
```


## Core Assignment: Simple Expense Tracker

### Assignment Overview

For this assignment, you will extend this authentication backend to create a basic expense tracker application. This will help you learn how to build upon an existing codebase by adding new models, controllers, and routes.

### Project Requirements

Building on the existing authentication system, implement the following features:

1. **Expense Management**
   - Create new expenses with amount, description, category, and date
   - View all expenses for the logged-in user
   - Update existing expenses

### Files You Need to Create

#### 1. Create the Expense Model
**File path:** `src/models/Expense.js`

Create an Expense model that includes:
- userId (to connect expenses to a specific user)
- amount (the cost of the expense)
- description (what the expense was for)
- category (like "Food", "Transportation", etc.)
- date (when the expense occurred)

#### 2. Create the Expense Controller
**File path:** `src/controllers/expense.controller.js`

Create an expense controller with these functions:
- `createExpense`: Add a new expense to the database
- `getExpenses`: Retrieve all expenses for a specific user
- `updateExpense`: Update an existing expense by its ID

#### 3. Create the Expense Routes
**File path:** `src/routes/expense.route.js`

Create routes that define these API endpoints:
- `POST /api/expense/create`: Create a new expense
- `GET /api/expense/all`: Fetch all expenses for a user
- `PUT /api/expense/update`: Update an expense by ID

#### 4. Update the Main Entry File
**File to modify:** `index.js`

Add your new expense routes to the main application by importing your expense router and adding the appropriate `app.use()` statement.

### Final Project Structure

When you're done, your project structure should look like this:


```

│   │   └── Expense.js       # Expense model - defines expense properties
│   └── db/
│       └── connectDB.js     # Database connection - connects to MongoDB
└── .env                     # Environment variables (not in repository)
```
